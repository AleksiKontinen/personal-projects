# what is this
This is my custom cat feeder project.
# why
I wanted to learn PCB desing and not wake up every morning at 8 o'clock to feed my cat. Also Telegram bot api and camera stuff peaked my intrest so here we are.

# use of AI in my projects
I use AI mainly to speedup my research and learning. AI is most prominently seen in my test codes. Test codes are used to test indivitual components and desing choises.
