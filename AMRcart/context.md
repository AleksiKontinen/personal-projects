# what is this
This is my robotic cart project.

# why
I have never built anyting mobile and got my hands on a broken hoverboard. So I salvaged the motors and the large li-ion battery pack.
In this project I want to learn about control systems, kinematics and algorithms that makes these kind of robots work. 

# use of AI in my projects
I use AI mainly to speedup my research and learning. AI is most prominently seen in my test codes. Test codes are used to test indivitual components and desing choises.
