# Kibble Ball Dispenser

This is the first iteration of the cat feeder. It has rotating drum that dispenses different types of puzzle balls for my cat to play with.
I went as far to add esp32 with website UI and RTC data to schedule cats feeding time. 
## Conclution
Ultimately the physical and electical desing of the feeder was too flawed to continue, also my cat found ways to exploit the system so I desided to end and start fresh.
