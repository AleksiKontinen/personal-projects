# 3-axis robot arm with remote controlling and playback

Reason for this project was my kinematics course. And also a year long brake from building anything. Arm was controlled with ps4 controller and had a memory
and playback. It also had 2 different modes: kinematic and free drive mode. 
## Concusion
It was fun to see my math at work when the arm moved as I calculated. I propably will come back and make new one someday.
